To run test cases, enter command: "./a.out < testcases/9x9_1.txt"

By default the name of the program is a.out. But it can be whatever you name it

I have a total of 12 test cases. 3 test cases for each sizes: 4x4 6x6 9x9 16x16

To switch to the next test case, you can simply change the number after '_' to the next number.

So 9x9_1.txt ---> 9x9_2.txt

My test cases were randomly generated by ai. So some may not be solvable as it wasn't given the prompt to make all puzzles to be solvable. I still included them as to show that the program knows it can't be solved as well. 

NOTE: the 16x16 tests will take a few seconds to complete.
